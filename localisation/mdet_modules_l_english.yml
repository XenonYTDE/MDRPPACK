Because of this, the rounds are often stored in a carousel under or near the gun. In a tank with an autoloader the crew has to share the compartment with live ammo. While an autoloader gives a much better rate of fire than manual loading, a penetrating hit will often cook-off the ammo and burn the tank and its crew to a crisp.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: An autoloader grants the ability of more sustained firepower on targets, but makes the vehicle more likely to be catastrophically lost when damaged§!"
