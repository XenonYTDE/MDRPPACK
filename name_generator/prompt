I am trying to generate names for a mod for the game Hearts of Iron 4 (HOI4)
Please generate names for military equipment for Canada (CAN)
Name Generation:
- Use current equipment from that country to generate names. For example, Spain developed the `CS-70` MANPATS system in 2023, so future MANPATS systems might be called `CS-81`, `CS-95`, etc.
- If a country doesn't have existing equipment for a certain category, use a combination of the country's name and the equipment category in that country's native/official language as a prefix,, and a random number as the model code.
    For example:
        Thailand anti tank example:
            Using Thailand's country name: TH
            In Thai, MANPATS might be translated to ระบบต้านทางถล่มพลังงานที่นำไปใช้ได้โดยมนุษย์ (rabop tan thang thalom phalang ngaan thi nam pai chai dai doy mansayam)
            Use the starting characters of the first 2 words: RT
            Random number: 82
            Final equipment name: `Anti_tank_5: "THRT 82"`
        Indian infantry weapons (assault rifle) example:
            Using India's country name: IN
            In Hindi, assault rifle might be translated as "हमला बंदूक" (hamla bandook)
            Use the starting characters of the first 2 words: HB
            Random number: 48
            Final equipment name: `infantry_weapons11: "INHB-48"`
Instructions:
- Use that Canada's native/official language
- Convert name to latin characters
- list them out in a code block (MUST include country tag):
